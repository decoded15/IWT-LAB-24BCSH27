        Importance of CSS in Web Design :
        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) plays a vital role in web design because it controls the appearance and layout of a website, making it visually attractive and user-friendly. It allows developers to separate content from design, which makes websites easier to manage, update, and maintain. With CSS, designers can control colors, fonts, spacing, animations, and responsive layouts, ensuring that websites look good on all devices such as mobiles, tablets, and desktops. It also improves loading speed by reducing the need for repeated formatting in HTML and enhances user experience by providing consistency across web pages. Overall, CSS is essential for creating modern, professional, and interactive websites.
